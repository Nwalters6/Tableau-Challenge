Congratulations on your new job! As the new lead analyst for the [New York Citi Bike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citi_Bike) Program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers. 

# Peak Summer/Winter Hours - Citi Bike Analytics
The peak hours for summer months are the mornings and the evenings such as 7 am, 8 am and 9 am. The peak hours for the winter months are mostly the evening hours such as 6 pm, 7 pm, and 9 pm. Overall, it appears that the most popular times to ride a bike is during the evening or morning. This may be due to commuting times.

# Each Stations Popularity Over Time - Citi Bike Analytics
It appears that they are getting more popular as time goes on with the peak being over the summer months. I believe that this is due to the nice weather in New York compared to the snowy weather that they recieve during the winter.
